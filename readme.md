# DomLink Headless

This package provides the bare minimum to get [DomLink](https://github.com/hotsocket-fyi/domlink-core) working outside of a browser.

To use this package, import it before the main DomLink package.
```ts
import "jsr:@domlink/headless";
import * as DL from "jsr:@domlink/core";
```
